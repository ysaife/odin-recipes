# odin-recipes
This project is a basic webpage describing my mom's Lebanese hummus recipe. It will serve me as a refresher for HTML basics. It will also be the first time I will put in practice the Git workflow learned in TOP.

My goals are:

- To review basic HTML concepts
- Be more comfortable when making commits
- Become proficient working with Visual Studio Code and Terminal
