    <h3>What is <em>falafel</em>?</h3>
    <p>Falafel is a popular Middle Eastern dish made from chickpeas or fava beans, combined with herbs and spices, and shaped into small balls or pucks.</p>
    <p>Air fryer falafel is a healthier alternative to traditional deep-fried falafel.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Dry Large Broad Beans</li>
        <li>Dry Chickpeas</li>
        <li>Boiled Potato</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Mint</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Allspice</li>
        <li>Baking Soda</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Coriander Seed</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the beans overnight. It is important that the dried chickpeas and fava beans be soaked overnight in triple the amount of water to rehydrate them as they will double in size. </li>
        <li>Drain and peel the fava beans. The next day, rinse and drain the beans, let them sit in a colander, so excess water can be expelled. Peel the skins of the fava beans, which should come off very easily. Discard the skins.</li>
        <li>Use a high-speed food processor to process the mixture. Add the hydrated beans, and process them until they become roughly chopped, about a minute.</li>
        <li>Add in all the other ingredients and then process for a minute at a time, scraping down the sides and bring up the bottom to ensure the mixture is processed evenly.</li>
        <li>Repeat 5 to 6 times. The mixture will be a fine grainy wet-crumb (moist).</li>
        <li>Rest the mixture. Place your mixture into a bowl and knead it with your hands for a minute until you feel that everything is evenly mixed and there are no large pieces. Cover it with cling film and let it rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Make the falafel balls. Lightly brush the pan of your air fryer with some cooking oil.</li>
        <li>Add your mixture to a falafel maker, pack it tight, and shape it into a domed puck (just over an inch thick).</li>
        <li>Gently place it onto the oiled air fryer tray and gently brush the top of the falafel ball. Repeat this until the tray is filled with falafel balls, ensuring that they do not touch each other.</li>
        <li>Air fry on high (200C/392F) until golden brown (about 15 minutes - see tips below) gently turning halfway. Serve immediately. (this is similar to the air fryer I use)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
